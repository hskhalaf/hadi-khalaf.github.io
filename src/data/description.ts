  "My research focuses on developing robust and scalable tools for AI post-training. I try to re-engineer optimization and evaluation workflows to target complex capabilities directly." +
  " By grounding these workflows in both theoretical rigor and scalable practices," +
  " my goal is to help build AI systems that are capable of helping us address our most complex and important challenges.";
