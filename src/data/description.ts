  "Hi, I'm Hadi! I'm a second year Computer Science PhD student at Harvard. I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. <a href='https://people.seas.harvard.edu/~flavio/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' style='text-decoration: none; color: #000000; transition: color 0.2s;' onmouseover='this.style.color=\"#2563eb\"' onmouseout='this.style.color=\"#000000\"'>Flavio Calmon</a>. <br/> <br/> " +
  "My research focuses on developing robust and scalable tools for <span style='color: #2563eb;'>AI post-training</span>. I re-engineer training and evaluation workflows to target desired capabilities, without relying on noisy proxies.  <br/> <br/>" +
  // " By grounding these workflows in theoretical rigor," +
  // " my goal is to build AI systems that are capable of helping us address our most complex and important challenges. <br/> <br/>" +
  "Before starting my PhD, I was a research intern at the Economics Department at Harvard, where I worked on partial identification and algorithmic game theory. I also worked in machine learning for urban planning at the Beirut Urban Lab and in computational nuclear engineering at MIT as a Research Science Institute fellow. <br/> <br/>" +
  "I am always happy to chat about research or grad school applications on hadikhalaf [at] g dot harvard dot edu. " +
  "You can find my PhD application material <a href='/Hadi Khalaf - PhD App Material.pdf' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' style='text-decoration: none; color: #2563eb;'>here</a>."
