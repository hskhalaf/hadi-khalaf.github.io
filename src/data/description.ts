  "My research focuses on developing robust and scalable tools for <span style='color: #2563eb;'>AI post-training</span>. I try to re-engineer optimization and evaluation workflows to target complex capabilities directly without relying on noisy proxies." +
  " By grounding these workflows in theoretical rigor," +
  " my goal is to build AI systems that are capable of helping us address our most complex and important challenges.";
